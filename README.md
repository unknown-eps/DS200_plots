# Pune Municipal Financial Health Analysis (2014-2020)

## Disclamer
**Github Copilot** was used in writing the plotting code and constructing the README file. 

## Overview
This project analyzes the financial health of Pune Municipal Corporation from 2014 to 2020 using comprehensive data visualization techniques. The analysis focuses on municipal revenue, expenditure patterns, and net profit trends over a seven-year period.

## Data Sources
- **Primary Dataset**: `Pune FinancialHealth2022.csv`
- **Data Period**: Financial Years 2014-15 to 2020-21
- **Geographic Scope**: Pune Municipal Corporation
- **Data Provider**: Municipal financial records and public administration databases

### Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following key variables:
- **City Name**: Pune (constant across all records)
- **Year**: Financial year in format YYYY-YY (e.g., 2020-21)
- **Municipal's Revenue**: Total revenue generated by the municipal corporation (in thousands)
- **Municipal's Expenditure**: Total expenditure incurred by the municipal corporation (in thousands)
- **Net Profit**: Calculated metric (Revenue - Expenditure) indicating financial surplus/deficit

## Data Processing
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed null/missing values using `dropna()`
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created `net_profit` column as the difference between revenue and expenditure
3. **Data Preparation**: Removed the original 'Total Profit/Loss' column for consistency

## Visualizations and Analysis

### 1. Scatter Plot: Municipal Revenue vs Expenditure
**File**: `plots/scatter_plot.png`

**Observations**:
- Strong positive correlation between revenue and expenditure
- Most data points cluster around the 400,000-450,000 range for both metrics
- 2020-21 shows the highest values for both revenue (471,331) and expenditure (480,144)
- 2014-15 represents the lowest financial activity with revenue of 332,576 and expenditure of 319,542

**Analysis**: The scatter plot reveals that Pune's municipal spending generally scales with revenue generation, indicating responsive fiscal management. However, the proximity of points to the diagonal suggests periods where expenditure exceeded revenue.

### 2. Box Plot: Distribution of Financial Metrics
**File**: `plots/box_plot.png`

**Observations**:
- **Revenue Distribution**: Median around 400,000 with relatively tight quartile ranges
- **Expenditure Distribution**: Similar median to revenue but with slightly wider spread
- **Net Profit Distribution**: Highly variable with both positive and negative values
- **Outliers**: Net profit shows the most variability, indicating inconsistent financial performance

**Analysis**: The box plots reveal that while revenue and expenditure follow similar distribution patterns, net profit exhibits high volatility. This suggests that small changes in the revenue-expenditure balance significantly impact municipal financial health.

### 3. Bar Plot: Revenue and Expenditure by Year
**File**: `plots/bar_plot.png`

**Observations**:
- **2014-2015**: Lowest financial activity, positive net profit
- **2015-2016**: Significant revenue increase with moderate expenditure growth
- **2016-2017**: Expenditure exceeded revenue, resulting in deficit
- **2017-2018**: Strong revenue recovery with controlled expenditure
- **2018-2020**: Relatively stable high-level financial operations
- **2020-2021**: Peak revenue and expenditure levels

**Analysis**: The bar chart shows a general upward trend in both revenue and expenditure over time, with notable fluctuations in the revenue-expenditure balance. The 2016-17 period appears to be a challenging year with expenditure exceeding revenue.

### 4. Line Plot: Net Profit Trend Over Years
**File**: `plots/line_plot.png`

**Observations**:
- **2014-15**: Modest positive profit (13,034)
- **2015-16**: Peak performance with highest profit (55,290)
- **2016-17**: Significant loss (-36,083) - worst performing year
- **2017-18**: Strong recovery with substantial profit (40,411)
- **2018-19**: Return to deficit (-16,038)
- **2019-20**: Near break-even with slight loss (-1,483)
- **2020-21**: Moderate deficit (-8,813)

**Analysis**: The line plot reveals a highly volatile financial performance with dramatic swings between profit and loss. The pattern suggests cyclical financial management challenges, possibly related to infrastructure investments, economic conditions, or policy changes.

## Key Findings

### Financial Performance Trends
1. **Revenue Growth**: Consistent upward trend from ₹332.6 million (2014-15) to ₹471.3 million (2020-21)
2. **Expenditure Patterns**: Generally aligned with revenue but with periods of overspending
3. **Profitability Cycles**: Alternating periods of surplus and deficit, indicating volatile financial management

### Critical Observations
1. **Best Performance**: 2015-16 with net profit of ₹55.3 million
2. **Worst Performance**: 2016-17 with net loss of ₹36.1 million
3. **Financial Stability**: High correlation (0.85+) between revenue and expenditure suggests responsive budgeting
4. **Recent Trend**: 2018-2021 period shows consistent deficits, indicating potential structural challenges

### Policy Implications
1. **Budget Balance**: Need for improved revenue-expenditure alignment
2. **Financial Planning**: Evidence suggests requirement for better long-term financial forecasting
3. **Revenue Enhancement**: Opportunities for diversifying municipal revenue sources
4. **Expenditure Control**: Requirement for more disciplined spending practices
